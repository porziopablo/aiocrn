# Art Institute of Chicago React Native Challenge

This is a React Native challenge that I had to develop for a recruiting process. The task is to build a mobile application that allows an user to navigate the events exposed by the Art Institute of Chicago API. The user should be able to see a thumbnail and a small description of each event in the main screen of the app. When clicking on a thumbnail the user must be sent to a detailed screen of the event containing a better quality image and more detailed information about the piece, the author, and any other data that might be relevant for the end user. The user should be able to save some favorite events, and should be able to explore them even after the application is completely closed and reopened.

### Notes
 - The app should use animated transitions and any other cool feature that will show up how experienced you are in mobile development.
 - Code quality, clarity and development best practices are evaluated.
 - The app should be built using React Native CLI and Typescript.
 - Select you preferred platform (iOS or Android) and create your own Native Module using the Bridge or the Fabric Native Components to add the events schedules into the user calendar, without using a React Native package.
 - Additional bonus if some kind of push notifications are implemented.

## Run the challenge

### Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:porziopablo/aiocrn.git
```

### Step 2: Install Node dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Step 3: Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Go to Step 4 to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app.

### Step 4: Start the app

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```
